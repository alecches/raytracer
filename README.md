# Raytracer Challenge

Hi! This is my repo for my read-through of *The Ray Tracer Challenge* by Jamis Buck. I'll be writing a ray tracer guided by this book. I'm going to be primarily using C++ in this implementation (a resource I continually find myself reaching for is *A Tour of C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup), and for now I intend not to use any libraries besides std.

## Project Goals

I hope to implement a functional 3D renderer and to learn along the way. I will expand my knowledge of modern C++, of tools like Googletest, and  of the fundamental concepts that 3D rendering involves: linear algebra, lighting, color, textures, etc.

## What I have so far...

At this point I have almost finished the book and I plan to implement more features soon!

Here is a sample of a simple scene of a reflective sphere with a hole in it that I rendered using only primitives:

And here is a rendering of the Utah teapot, parsed from a .obj file:

This is still a work-in-progress, I'm researching ways to optimize the renderer and expand what it does. Thanks for stopping by and taking a look.  :)
