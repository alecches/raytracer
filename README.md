# Raytracer Challenge

Hi! This is my repo for my read-through of *The Ray Tracer Challenge* by Jamis Buck. I'll be writing a raytracer guided completely by this book. Throughout college I used whatever programming langauge a class called for, and never really mastered any... I'm committing to using and learning more about C++ in this implementation (my main resource has been *A Tour of C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup).
