# Raytracer Challenge

Hi! This is my repo for my read-through of *The Ray Tracer Challenge* by Jamis Buck. I'll be writing a raytracer guided by this book. Throughout college I used whatever programming language a class called for, and never felt that I completely mastered any... I'm committing to using and learning more about C++ in this implementation (my main resource has been *A Tour of C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup) Hopefully the demands of the project will sharpen my modern C++ skills.

## Project Goals

I hope to implement a functional 3D renderer and to learn along the way. I will expand my knowledge of modern C++, of tools like Googletest, and  of the foundational concepts of rendering: linear algebra, lighting, color, textures, etc.

## What I have so far...

At this point I have completed the book and I plan to implement more features of my own!

Here is a sample of a simple scene of a reflective sphere with a hole in it that I rendered using only primitives:

![simple scene](../images/example-1.ppm)

And here is a rendering of the Utah teapot, parsed from a .obj file:

COMING SOON

This is still a work-in-progress, I'm researching ways to optimize the renderer and expand what it does. Thanks for stopping by and taking a look :)
